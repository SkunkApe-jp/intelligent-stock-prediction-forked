## Project Overview

This project presents a Stock Analysis & Market Sentiment system that integrates customer profiles, stock data, and predictive analytics into one full-stack web application. The system provides simulated buy/sell transactions, fund and dividend tracking, broker commission management, and an admin monitoring dashboard.

On the prediction side, an LSTM-based model (with classical ARIMA and Linear Regression baselines) forecasts future stock trends using historical prices, while a sentiment analysis module aggregates recent financial-news sentiment to give additional context. The backend is implemented in Python using Flask, with a SQLite database and responsive web interfaces, and the prediction outputs are visualised through interactive D3-based charts and summary widgets on the results page.

The proposed system is intended for students, researchers, and amateur investors who wish to explore stock prediction and portfolio management in a safe, simulated environment. It closes gaps in the literature by embedding forecasting models into an end-to-end management workflow with explainable dashboards rather than providing prediction in isolation.

## Key Features

### Portfolio Management
- User registration and authentication with role-based access control
- Virtual wallet and fund tracking for simulated trading
- Stock buy/sell operations with commission calculations
- Dividend recording and tracking
- Portfolio holdings visualization and performance metrics

### Prediction Engine
- LSTM neural network for stock price prediction
- Classical baseline models (ARIMA, Linear Regression)
- Financial news sentiment analysis using multiple sources
- Interactive visualization of prediction accuracy
- Seven-day forward price forecasting

### Administration
- User and company management
- Broker configuration with commission rates
- Transaction monitoring and reporting
- System statistics dashboard

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **Flask** - Web framework
- **SQLite** - Database management
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM for database operations

### Machine Learning & Analytics
- **TensorFlow/Keras** - Deep learning framework
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Statsmodels** - Statistical modeling (ARIMA)
- **NLTK** - Natural language processing
- **TextBlob/FinVADER** - Sentiment analysis
- **YFinance** - Stock market data retrieval
- **Alpha Vantage** - Financial data API

### Frontend
- **HTML5/CSS3** - Markup and styling
- **Bootstrap** - Responsive design framework
- **JavaScript** - Client-side interactivity
- **D3.js** - Data visualization
- **jQuery** - DOM manipulation

## Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: Responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript
2. **Application Layer**: Python/Flask backend implementing business logic, prediction models, and data processing
3. **Data Layer**: SQLite database managed through SQLAlchemy ORM

## System Components

### Database Schema
The system uses a relational database with the following key entities:
- **User**: Authentication and profile information
- **Company**: Stock information and metadata
- **Broker**: Commission configuration
- **PortfolioItem**: User holdings tracking
- **Transaction**: Buy/sell records with commission tracking
- **Dividend**: Dividend payout records

### Prediction Models
Three predictive models are implemented:
1. **LSTM Neural Network**: Deep learning model for complex pattern recognition
2. **ARIMA**: Classical statistical model for time series forecasting
3. **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline model for comparison

### Sentiment Analysis
Financial news sentiment is gathered from multiple sources:
- Finviz scraping with FinVADER sentiment analysis
- Alternative news sources as fallbacks
- Aggregation of sentiment scores over time windows
